## Description:

This is an example of a backend portion of an application, that you might expect to access with API calls. Using Sequelize, it'll allow the server to process requests, pull the relevant data needed, then spit it back to the frontend to be used for whatever purpose.

## Usage:

Since this is all serverside, one can run this by navigating to the command prompt and doing the following:

- Navigate to the directory of the backend
- log into mysql, then type in 'source db/schema.sql' to prepare a new empty database
- Exit mysql, then type in 'npm run seed' to fill the newly created database with data.
- After all that, just type in npm start to boot up the server!

For the purpose of trying out its functionality, a program like Insomnia is recommended.
